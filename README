General Information
===================

Currently there's no lack of terminal emulators, however they all seem to offer no clean separation between
drawing toolkit and terminal emulation.
libTE is a terminal emulation library that aims to fill this gap of terminal emulation as a library.
The aim is to provide the commonly used parts of DEC vt102 and xterm functionality as a clean, modern
separate library.
The only requirements are C99 support and Posix+UNIX98 for pty features.

API/ABI
=======
libTE follows the conventional method of versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.FIX
Where a change in MAJOR number means ABI/API breakage. MINOR versions are ABI backward compatible
but may introduce new features. FIX versions only contain fixes and improvements that does
not affect ABI or API issues. Code compiled against X.Y.Z should be safe to run with
any version x.y.z, where x==X and y>=Y.

The only headers files that are part of the API these:
 From C include only the file libte/libte.h
 C++ wrapper is provided as libte/libTE.hpp

libTE can be compiled with additional helpers for pty support which are compile time detectable by
the feature macro TE_ENABLE_PTY.
